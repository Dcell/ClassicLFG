# High Prio:
* After leaving a group you cannot list your own before chaning data
* After member left the group send update
* After decline of invite cannot requeue
* Parse messages in guild chat
* Advertise dungeon group in chat
* Settings GUI

# Low Prio:
* Party Leader Changed Delist group (maybe send confirmatio back when application is successful, otherwise delist group, might be too much traffic)
* Sync Party Applicants between members of the group
* Dont add own chat group

# Suggestions:

* Audio cues for ui interactions (clicking buttons, selecting stuff and maybe queue pop notification ?)
* Make window movable
