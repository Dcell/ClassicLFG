# High Prio:
* After leaving a group you cannot list your own before chaning data
* After decline of invite cannot requeue
* Parse messages in guild chat
* Settings GUI
* Fix multiple broadcasters for same group
* Dequeue Chat group on dequeue dungeon group

# Low Prio:
* Party Leader Changed Delist group (maybe send confirmatio back when application is successful, otherwise delist group, might be too much traffic)
* Sync Party Applicants between members of the group
* Dont add own chat group

# Suggestions:
* Audio cues for ui interactions (clicking buttons, selecting stuff and maybe queue pop notification ?)
* Make window movable
