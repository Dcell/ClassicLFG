# High Prio:


# Low Prio:
* Party Leader Changed Delist group (maybe send confirmatio back when application is successful, otherwise delist group, might be too much traffic)
* Sync Party Applicants between members of the group
* Memory leak for starting broadcasts for groups in group manager (register from eventbus with broadcaster)
* After leaving a group you cannot list your own before changing data
* After decline of invite cannot requeue


# Suggestions:


# Gamko
