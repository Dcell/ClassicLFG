# High Prio:
- After leaving a group you cannot list your own before chaning data

# Low Prio:
* Party Leader Changed Delist group (maybe send confirmatio back when application is successful, otherwise delist group, might be too much traffic)

# Suggestions:

* Audio cues for ui interactions (clicking buttons, selecting stuff and maybe queue pop notification ?)
* Make window movable
