# High Prio:
* When group leader is changed send out update group for listed group

# Low Prio:

* Party Leader Changed Delist group (maybe send confirmatio back when application is successful, otherwise delist group, might be too much traffic)

# Suggestions:

* Audio cues for ui interactions (clicking buttons, selecting stuff and maybe queue pop notification ?)
* Make window movable
